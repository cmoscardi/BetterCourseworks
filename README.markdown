BetterCourseworks! The name says it all. This site is very much a work in progress, but check it out at:
bettercourseworks.heroku.com

WHAT WORKS: 
-Login
-Listing courses
-Storing users/courses into the DB correctly
ALMOST WORKS: 
-The syllabus pages right after the frontpage
NOT WORKING:
Anything after that.

Now that the basic login functionality is done, the rest of the backend work should just be DB related, adding tables with URLs and pulling/storing resources such as .pdf readings.
